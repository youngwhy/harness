**All you need is requirements.**
A Claude Code plugin that derives requirements from your intent, verifies every derivation, and delivers traced code — without you writing a plan.

> *AI can build anything. The hard part is knowing what to build — precisely.*

Most AI coding fails at the **input**, not the output. The bottleneck isn't AI capability. It's human clarity. You say "add dark mode" and there are a hundred decisions hiding behind those three words.

Most tools either force you to enumerate them upfront, or ignore them entirely. Harness does neither — it **derives** them. Layer by layer. Gate by gate. From intent to verified code.

---

## Requirements Are Not Written

> *You don't know what you want until you're asked the right questions.*

Requirements aren't artifacts you produce before coding. They're **discoveries** — surfaced through structured interrogation of your intent. Every "add a feature" conceals unstated assumptions. Every "fix the bug" hides a root cause you haven't named yet.

Harness's job is to find what you haven't said.

```
  You say:     "add dark mode toggle"
                    │
  Harness asks: "System preference or manual?"     ← assumption exposed
               "Which components need variants?"   ← scope clarified
               "Persist where? How?"               ← decision forced
                    │
  Result:      3 requirements, 8 sub-requirements, 4 tasks — all linked
```

This is not just process. It's built on three beliefs about how AI coding should work.

### 1. Requirements over tasks

> *Get the requirements right, and the code writes itself. Get them wrong, and no amount of code fixes it.*

Most AI tools jump straight to tasks — "create file X, edit function Y." But tasks are derivatives. They change when requirements change. If you start from tasks, you're building on sand.

Harness starts from **goals** and derives downward through a layer chain:

```
Goal → Decisions → Requirements → Sub-requirements → Tasks
```

Requirements are refined from multiple angles before a single line of code is written. Interviewers probe assumptions. Gap analyzers find what's missing. UX reviewers check user impact. Tradeoff analyzers weigh alternatives. Each perspective sharpens the requirements until they're precise enough to generate verifiable sub-requirements.

The chain is directional: **requirements produce tasks, never the reverse.** If requirements change, sub-requirements and tasks are re-derived. This is why Harness can recover from mid-execution blockers — the requirements are still valid, only the tasks need adjustment.

### 2. Determinism by design

> *LLMs are non-deterministic. The system around them doesn't have to be.*

An LLM given the same prompt twice may produce different code. This is the fundamental challenge of AI-assisted development. Harness's answer: **constrain the LLM with programmatic control** so that non-determinism doesn't propagate.

Three mechanisms enforce this:

- **`requirements.md` + `plan.json` as structured artifacts** — `/specify` produces `requirements.md` (the what). `/blueprint` produces `plan.json` with contracts and task graphs (the how). Every agent reads from these shared artifacts. No agent invents its own context. No information lives only in a conversation. These artifacts are the shared memory that survives context windows, compaction, and agent handoffs.

- **CLI-enforced structure** — `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh"` validates plan structure and task state transitions. Field names, types, required relationships — all checked programmatically before the LLM ever sees the data. The CLI doesn't suggest structure; it **rejects** invalid structure.

- **Derivation chain as contract** — Goal → Decisions → Requirements → Sub-requirements → Tasks are linked. Each layer references the one above it. A sub-requirement traces to a requirement. A task traces to requirements via `fulfills`. If the chain breaks, the gate blocks. This means: **if you have valid requirements, the system will produce a result** — deterministically routed, even if the LLM's individual outputs vary.

The LLM does the creative work. The system ensures it stays on rails.

### 3. Machine-verifiable by default

> *If a human has to check it, the system failed to automate it.*

Every sub-requirement in `requirements.md` is a testable behavioral statement:

```json
{
  "id": "R1.1",
  "behavior": "Clicking dark mode toggle switches theme to dark"
}
```

Sub-requirements serve as acceptance criteria. Workers verify their own implementation against sub-requirement behaviors (with optional `--tdd` for test-first workflow). Code review runs independently, catching cross-cutting integration issues that per-task verification misses.

Human review is reserved for what machines genuinely can't judge — UX feel, business logic correctness, naming decisions. Everything else runs automatically, every time, without asking.

### 4. Knowledge compounds

> *Most AI tools start from zero every session. Harness remembers.*

Every execution generates structured learnings — not logs, not chat history, but **typed knowledge**: what went wrong, why, and the rule to prevent it next time.

```
  /execute runs → Worker hits edge case
       │
  Worker records:
    { problem: "localStorage quota exceeded at 5MB",
      cause:   "No size check before write",
      rule:    "Always check remaining quota before localStorage.setItem" }
       │
  Next /specify → searches past learnings via BM25
       │
  Result: "Found: localStorage quota issue in todo-app spec.
           → Adding R5: quota guard requirement automatically"
```

This is **cross-spec compounding**. A lesson learned in one project surfaces as a requirement in the next. The system doesn't just avoid repeating mistakes — it actively strengthens future specs with evidence from past executions.

Three mechanisms make this work:

- **Structured learnings** — Workers record structured learnings during execution, saved to `learnings.json` and auto-mapped to the requirements and tasks that produced them
- **Cross-project search** — BM25 search across all projects: requirements, sub-requirements, constraints, and learnings. What you learned in project A informs what you ask in project B
- **Compounding loop** — Each /specify session starts by searching past learnings. More projects → richer search results → more complete requirements → fewer surprises during execution → better learnings → the cycle continues

The result: **the tenth project you run through Harness is meaningfully better than the first** — not because the LLM improved, but because the knowledge base did.

---

These aren't aspirations. They're enforced by the architecture — the CLI rejects invalid specs, gates block unverified layers, hooks guard writes, agents verify in isolation, and learnings compound across projects. The system is designed so that **doing the right thing is the path of least resistance.**

## See It In Action

```
You:  /specify "add dark mode toggle to settings page"

  Harness interviews you (decision-based):
  ├─ "User opens the app at night — should it auto-detect OS dark mode or require a manual toggle?"
  ├─ "User switches to dark mode mid-session — should charts/images also invert?"
  └─ derives implications: CSS variables needed, localStorage for persistence, prefers-color-scheme media query

  Agents research your codebase in parallel:
  ├─ code-explorer scans component structure
  ├─ docs-researcher checks design system conventions
  └─ ux-reviewer flags potential regression

  → requirements.md generated:
    3 requirements, 8 sub-requirements — all linked

You:  /blueprint
  → plan.json generated:
    4 tasks with contracts, dependency graph, and fulfills links

You:  /execute

  Harness orchestrates:
  ├─ Worker agents implement each task in parallel (--tdd: tests first)
  ├─ Code review: cross-cutting integration review
  └─ Final Verify: goal + constraints + sub-requirements — holistic check

  → Done. Every file change traced to a requirement.
```

```
/specify → Interview exposed hidden assumptions

/blueprint → Contract-first task graph planning
             → Tasks derived from requirements with contracts

```

The chain ran from intent to proof. Every derivation verified.

## The Derivation Chain

Six layers. Each derived from the one before it. Each gated before the next begins.

```
  L0: Goal           "add dark mode toggle"
   ↓  ◇ gate         is the goal clear?
  L1: Context        codebase analysis, UX review, docs research
   ↓  ◇ gate         is the context sufficient?
  L2: Decisions      decision interview → implications derivation (L2.5)
   ↓  ◇ gate         are decisions justified?
  L3: Requirements   R1: "Toggle switches theme" → sub-requirements
   ↓  ◇ gate         are requirements complete?
  L4: Tasks          T1: "Add toggle component" → fulfills, depends_on
   ↓  ◇ gate         do tasks cover all requirements?
  Plan Approval      summary + user confirmation → /execute
```

Each gate has two checks:
- **Merge checkpoint** — CLI validates structure and completeness
- **Gate-keeper** — agent team reviews for scope drift, blind spots, and unnecessary complexity

Nothing advances without passing both. The chain is only as strong as its weakest link — so every link is verified.

### The Pipeline Contract

`/specify` produces `requirements.md` — the structured requirements. `/blueprint` produces `plan.json` — the task graph with contracts. `/execute` reads `plan.json` and dispatches workers.

The chain of evidence: **requirement → sub-requirement → task (fulfills) → done**. From intent to proof.

---

## The Execution Engine

The orchestrator reads `plan.json` and dispatches parallel worker agents:

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  /execute                                           │
  │                                                     │
  │  Worker T1 ──→ Verifier T1 ──→ Commit T1             │
  │  Worker T2 ──→ Verifier T2 ──→ Commit T2  (parallel)│
  │  Worker T3 ──→ Verifier T3 ──→ Commit T3             │
  │       │                                             │
  │       ▼                                             │
  │  Code Review (Codex + Gemini + Claude)              │
  │       │  independent reviews → synthesized verdict  │
  │       ▼                                             │
  │  Final Verify                                       │
  │    ✓ goal alignment                                 │
  │    ✓ constraint compliance                          │
  │    ✓ acceptance criteria                            │
  │    ✓ requirement coverage                           │
  │       │                                             │
  │       ▼                                             │
  │  Report                                             │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Workers implement, then independent Verifier agents check each task's sub-requirements — no judgment, no bypass.

### The Plan Is Alive

> *A plan that can't adapt is a plan that will be abandoned.*

`plan.json` is not a static document frozen at planning time. It's a **living contract** that evolves during execution — within strict, deterministic bounds.

When a worker discovers that the real codebase doesn't match the plan's assumptions, the plan adapts:

```
  plan.json at plan time:
    tasks: [T1, T2, T3]           ← 3 planned tasks

  Worker T2 hits a blocker:
    "T2 requires a util function that doesn't exist"
       │
       ▼
  System derives T2-fix:
    tasks: [T1, T2, T3, T2-fix]   ← plan grows, append-only
       │
       ▼
  T2-fix executes → T2 retries → passes
    tasks: [T1 ✓, T2 ✓, T3 ✓, T2-fix ✓]
```

This is **bounded adaptation** — the plan grows but never mutates. Three rules keep it deterministic:

- **Append-only** — existing tasks are never modified, only new ones are added. The original plan stays intact as an audit trail.
- **Depth-1** — a derived task cannot derive further tasks. One level of adaptation, no cascading chains. This prevents the plan from spiraling into unbounded complexity.
- **Circuit breaker** — max retries per path before escalating to the user. The system knows when to stop trying and ask for help.

The key insight: **requirements don't change during execution — only tasks do.** The goals, decisions, and requirements that were validated through the derivation chain remain stable. Tasks are just the lowest layer, and they're the cheapest to re-derive. This is why the layer hierarchy matters: the higher the layer, the more stable it is.

```
  Stable during execution:
    L0: Goal           ← locked
    L1: Context        ← locked
    L2: Decisions      ← locked
    L3: Requirements   ← locked
    L3: Sub-reqs       ← locked (behavioral acceptance criteria)

  Adaptable during execution:
    L4: Tasks          ← can grow (append-only, depth-1)
```

The plan doesn't predict the future. It survives it — by knowing which parts to hold firm and which parts to flex.
