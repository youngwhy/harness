# specify: Goal → Requirements via Systematic Interview

## Overview

Transform a vague goal into structured, traceable requirements through:
0. **WHERE Grounding** — establish project type, situation, ambition, and risk modifiers
0.5. **Context Research** (brownfield only) — scan existing codebase before asking the user
1. **Interview** — systematic Q&A across Business/Interaction/Tech axes (depth-calibrated by WHERE)
2. **Extract** — parallel requirements extraction by domain experts
3. **Cross-check** — conflict/gap/duplicate detection
4. **Confirmation** — user accepts assumptions + final `requirements.md` committed in cli format

## Handoff contract

The final deliverable is `<spec_dir>/requirements.md` in the format that `/blueprint` consumes:
- Frontmatter: `type` (greenfield|feature|refactor|bugfix), `goal`, `non_goals[]`
- Body: flat list of `## R-X<num>:` parent requirements, each with nested `#### R-X<num>.Y:` sub-requirements carrying `given/when/then`
- `X` in the ID is axis code: **B**=Business, **U**=Interaction (user), **T**=Tech
- Optional `## Open Decisions` section with `### OD-N:` blocks

All intermediate files (qa-log.md, reqs-business.md, reqs-interaction.md, reqs-tech.md) stay in `<spec_dir>/` for traceability but are NOT read by /blueprint.

## Runtime Surface

### Claude Code

- Use `AskUserQuestion` for the structured interview forms described below.
- Use `Agent(subagent_type="...")` for brownfield research and extractor
  subagents.
- Claude hooks may initialize skill session state, but the durable output remains
  `<spec_dir>/requirements.md`.

### Codex

- Read and apply `codex/PLUGIN_RUNTIME.md`.
- Keep the same interview protocol and output format, but use Codex-native
  structured input when available; otherwise ask one concise plain-text question
  at a time.
- Use the resolved plugin root's `scripts/cli.sh req init` command for setup.
- Dispatch logical roles with their canonical `agents/<logical-role>.md`
  prompts. If no native subagent tool is available, perform the smallest direct
  research pass needed to complete `requirements.md`.
- Do not rely on hooks for session initialization or cleanup in Codex.

## Phase 0: WHERE Grounding

The **WHERE** is the combination of current situation and intended scope. It calibrates how deep the interview goes on each axis — without it, every project gets the same heavyweight treatment, which over-engineers toys and under-specs production systems.

### Step 0.1: Mirror (prove understanding before asking)

Before asking for goal/non-goals, present your understanding of the user's request using this template:

```markdown
**Mirror — Here's what I understood**

**Understanding:**
<1–2 sentences paraphrasing the user's request in your own words. Not a verbatim echo.>

**Goal:**
- <bullet 1: concrete outcome>

**Non-Goal (explicitly out of scope):**
- <bullet 1: exclusion — at least one must be inferred by you, not stated by user>

**Ambiguous (scope-level unknowns):**
- <ambiguity about what "done" means, what's included, or who the user is>
```

Then confirm via AskUserQuestion:
```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Does this match your intent?",
  options: [
    { label: "Approve", description: "Proceed to WHERE grounding" },
    { label: "Revise", description: "Fix goal/non-goal/scope" }
  ]
)
```

**Rules:**
- At least one Non-Goal and one Ambiguous item must be **inferred** by you — a pure echo is a violation
- Ambiguous items are **scope-level** only ("what are we building / for whom / done when?"), NOT tech choices
- Max 2 revision rounds. If still unclear, proceed and record residual ambiguities for Phase 1
- On Approve: extract `goal` and `non_goals` from the mirror (no need to re-ask in free-text)

### Step 0.2: WHERE Inference (infer-first, ask-only-on-uncertainty)

**Default behavior: infer from the working directory and the user's goal. Only ask the user about dimensions you genuinely cannot determine from evidence.**

Don't burn 4 cold-start questions on facts the codebase already answers. Most of `PROJECT_TYPE`, `SITUATION`, and risk factors are visible to you. Only `AMBITION` is reliably user-intent-driven.

#### Step 0.2.a: Gather signals (read-only)

Inspect the repo. Use evidence — file paths, not vibes:

- **PROJECT_TYPE signals**:
  - `package.json` + frontend deps (react, vue, svelte, vite) / `app/`, `src/components/` → user-facing
  - `package.json` + backend deps (express, fastify, nest) / `routes/`, `api/`, `controllers/` → api-service
  - `bin/`, `cli.ts`, `pyproject.toml` with `[project.scripts]`, single-binary Cargo project → dev-tool
  - `terraform/`, `k8s/`, `helm/`, `Dockerfile` + no app code → infrastructure
- **SITUATION signals**:
  - Empty repo or only scaffolding (single README, no src) → greenfield
  - Existing src tree, many files, established conventions → brownfield (extension or refactor depends on user's goal verb)
  - User's goal mentions a new module/feature inside existing project → hybrid
- **RISK signals**:
  - `auth/`, `session`, `passport`, `oauth`, `cookie`, `jwt` references → sensitive-data candidate
  - `prisma/schema.prisma` / `migrations/` with PII columns (email, phone, ssn) → sensitive-data
  - Payment SDKs (stripe, toss, iamport, paypal) → sensitive-data + external-exposure
  - Public route definitions (no auth middleware), webhooks, `/api/public` → external-exposure
  - `migrations/`, destructive scripts, public SDK exports → irreversible
  - Load balancers, queues (kafka, sqs, redis streams), CDN config → high-scale

If brownfield, you may dispatch a quick `code-explorer` here — but a cheap `ls` + `Read README.md` + `Glob` is often enough for inference. Don't over-spend on Phase 0.

#### Step 0.2.b: Construct tentative WHERE and present

Build a single block in the Mirror (extend Step 0.1's mirror, or send as follow-up):

```markdown
**Inferred Context** (confirm or override)

- **PROJECT_TYPE**: <inferred value>
  - Evidence: <file:line or path that supports this>
- **SITUATION**: <inferred value>
  - Evidence: <...>
- **AMBITION**: <best guess, mark confidence>
  - Confidence: low/medium/high — <why>
- **RISK factors**: [<inferred list, or "none detected">]
  - Evidence: <...>
```

Mark each dimension with confidence:
- **high**: evidence is unambiguous (e.g., `package.json` with react = user-facing)
- **medium**: evidence is suggestive but could be wrong
- **low**: little to no signal — needs user input

#### Step 0.2.c: Confirm or drill (single AskUserQuestion)

If ALL dimensions are medium/high confidence:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Confirm inferred context?",
  options: [
    { label: "Approve all", description: "Use inferred WHERE as-is" },
    { label: "Override some", description: "Correct one or more dimensions" }
  ]
)
```

On Override: ask follow-up only for the dimensions the user flags. Use the original option lists below as the menu for those targeted questions.

If ANY dimension is **low confidence** (typically AMBITION on truly new projects), skip the confirm-or-drill choice and ask **only the low-confidence dimensions directly**, batched in one AskUserQuestion. Do not re-ask high-confidence dimensions.

#### Option menus (for targeted drills)

Use these when the user picks "Override some" or when a dimension is low-confidence:

- **PROJECT_TYPE**: User-facing app / API or Service / Dev tool or Library / Infrastructure
- **SITUATION**: Greenfield / Brownfield extension / Brownfield refactor / Hybrid
- **AMBITION**: Toy or Experiment / Feature or MVP / Product
- **RISK factors** (multiSelect): Sensitive data / External exposure / Irreversible ops / High scale

Definitions match the originals: Toy = days, failure ok; Feature/MVP = 1-2 weeks, core only; Product = long-term, reliability + security matter. Risk factors escalate specific nodes to `deep` in Step 0.4.

### Step 0.3: Spec Name & Output Setup

- Determine **spec name** (kebab-case, e.g., `user-dashboard`)
- Decide `spec_dir`: default `.harness/specs/{spec-name}/`
- **Bootstrap via cli** — creates the directory AND writes a `requirements.md` stub with the correct frontmatter so /blueprint can read it later:
  ```bash
  bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh" req init <spec_dir> --type <greenfield|feature|refactor|bugfix> --goal "<one-line goal>"
  ```
  Map `WHERE.SITUATION` → `--type`:
  - `greenfield` → `greenfield`
  - `brownfield-extension` → `feature`
  - `brownfield-refactor` → `refactor`
  - `hybrid` → `feature` (or `refactor` if structural churn dominates)
  The stub is overwritten at Phase 4.3 once the interview is complete. If `<spec_dir>/requirements.md` already exists from a prior run, skip `req init` and proceed (the user is re-running specify on the same spec).
- Read the Q&A log template from `${baseDir}/templates/qa-log.md`
- Initialize `<spec_dir>/qa-log.md` with spec name, goal, non-goals, and the WHERE context filled in

### Step 0.4: Derive Axis Depth Calibration

Combine SITUATION × AMBITION × RISK_MODIFIERS to assign each taxonomy node a depth level (**light**, **standard**, or **deep**). Apply rules in order — later rules escalate, never downgrade.

**Step A — SITUATION base**:
- **Greenfield** → TECH.ARCH/DATA standard
- **Brownfield extension** → TECH.ARCH **deep**, TECH.COMPAT **deep**; BUSINESS.WHO **light**
- **Brownfield refactor** → TECH.ARCH **deep**, TECH.COMPAT **deep**, TECH.DATA **deep**
- **Hybrid** → blend Greenfield + Extension rules

**Step B — AMBITION modulation**:
- **Toy** → TECH.SECURITY **light**, BUSINESS.RISK **light**, INTERACTION.ACCESS **light**. Keep INTERACTION.JOURNEY/HAPPY standard.
- **Feature/MVP** → default standard; only honor deeps from Step A.
- **Product** → TECH.SECURITY **deep**, INTERACTION.ACCESS **deep**, BUSINESS.RISK **deep**, TECH.COMPAT **deep**.

**Step C — RISK_MODIFIERS escalation (override Step B downgrades)**:
- **sensitive-data** → TECH.SECURITY **deep**, TECH.DATA **deep**
- **external-exposure** → TECH.SECURITY **deep**, INTERACTION.ACCESS **deep**
- **irreversible** → BUSINESS.RISK **deep**, TECH.COMPAT **deep**
- **high-scale** → TECH.INFRA **deep**, TECH.ARCH **deep**

**Examples**:
- User-facing + Greenfield + Toy + no modifiers → light SECURITY/RISK/ACCESS, standard elsewhere
- User-facing + Greenfield + Toy + sensitive-data → SECURITY/DATA escalated to **deep** (small-but-dangerous)
- API-service + Brownfield-refactor + Product + external-exposure → virtually everything deep

**Project-type notes** — PROJECT_TYPE doesn't change calibration numbers, but it changes what each INTERACTION node *means* (the interaction-extractor reads project_type for lens selection).

Write the derived calibration into `qa-log.md` frontmatter as `depth_calibration:` so Phase 1 and the gap-auditor can read it.

## Phase 0.5: Context Research (brownfield only)

**Skip this phase entirely if `where.situation == greenfield`.** Run it for `brownfield-extension`, `brownfield-refactor`, and `hybrid`.

Why: brownfield work depends on existing code that the user may not fully remember. Asking the user "what's the architecture?" when the codebase is right there is wasteful and unreliable. Scan the code first, then interview them on decisions — not facts.

### Dispatch subagents in parallel

```
Task(subagent_type="code-explorer",
     prompt="Goal: {goal}. Find: existing patterns, modules, or files relevant to this change. Report as file:line format with brief summary.")

Task(subagent_type="code-explorer",
     prompt="Find project structure and toolchain: package manifests, build/test/lint commands, entry points, deployment config. Report as file:line format.")

Task(subagent_type="docs-researcher",
     prompt="Goal: {goal}. Search ADRs, READMEs, docs/, CLAUDE.md, config files for conventions, architecture decisions, and constraints relevant to this work. Report as file:line format.")
```

For `brownfield-refactor` specifically, add:

```
Task(subagent_type="code-explorer",
     prompt="Find all call sites and dependents of {the area being refactored}. Report impact surface as file:line format.")
```

### Consolidate into `qa-log.md` → `research:` section

Write findings into `qa-log.md` under a new top-level heading `## Research` (before the axis sections). Include:
- Existing architecture summary (1-3 sentences)
- Relevant files/modules (with file:line anchors)
- Toolchain (build/test/lint)
- Existing constraints or conventions discovered
- Potential impact surface (for refactors)

Also add `research_done: true` to the `where:` frontmatter block so later phases can rely on it.

### Interview uses research as baseline

During Phase 1, when asking Tech axis questions:
- Reference the research findings ("I see you use Vite + TypeScript — is that still the target?" instead of "what's your build tool?")
- Only ask the user for **decisions** (what they want) and **intent** (why), not **facts** (what exists — we already found those)

## Phase 1: Interview

### Interview Protocol

You are the interviewer. Ask questions **one axis at a time**, following this taxonomy:

```
Axis 1: BUSINESS    — WHO, WHY, WHAT, SUCCESS, SCOPE, RISK
Axis 2: INTERACTION — JOURNEY, HAPPY, EDGE, STATE, FEEDBACK, ACCESS
Axis 3: TECH        — ARCH, DATA, INFRA, DEPEND, COMPAT, SECURITY
```

**The INTERACTION axis is consumer-generic.** Reinterpret nodes based on `where.project_type`:

| project_type | JOURNEY | HAPPY | FEEDBACK | ACCESS |
|--------------|---------|-------|----------|--------|
| user-facing | User entry → outcome | Core UI flow | Visual/audio reactions | Permissions, a11y |
| api-service | Consumer integration flow | Canonical API call | HTTP responses, errors | Auth, rate limits |
| dev-tool | Install → invoke → result | `--help` / canonical use | stdout+exit codes | Install, platform |
| infrastructure | Operator procedure | Green deploy path | Dashboards, alerts | RBAC, IAM |

EDGE/STATE are universal: failures & conditional behavior apply everywhere.

### Question Rules

**PRIMARY: Use AskUserQuestion tool for all interview questions.**
Free-text prompting should only be a fallback when options genuinely cannot be enumerated.

#### Why AskUserQuestion

- Directly implements **Recognition over Recall** — user picks from concrete options
- Options with `description` field show consequences/trade-offs per choice
- "Other" is auto-added — user can always override with custom answer
- Supports **batching** (1-4 questions per call) — pair related questions together
- `multiSelect: true` for non-exclusive choices

#### Batching Guidance

**Batch when**:
- Questions are within the same axis node and mutually informative (e.g., WHO + WHAT)
- Questions are orthogonal and won't confuse the user (e.g., STATE + FEEDBACK)
- User has already given broad context and is ready for several specifics

**Do NOT batch when**:
- A later question's options depend on the answer to an earlier one (ask sequentially)
- The first question is a depth drill that may trigger more drills (go one-at-a-time)
- User seems uncertain — a single focused question is less overwhelming

Max 4 per call (tool limit). Default: batch 2-3 related questions per turn.

#### Question Construction

Each AskUserQuestion option must have:
- `label`: 1-5 words (what the user picks)
- `description`: the consequence/implication of this choice
- First option gets "(Recommended)" suffix only when you genuinely have a recommendation

**Example** (batched):
```
questions: [
  {
    question: "Who is the primary user?",
    header: "Primary user",
    options: [
      { label: "Senior developers", description: "Power users; expect depth + customization" },
      { label: "Junior developers", description: "Learning users; expect guidance + safe defaults" },
      { label: "Both equally", description: "Dual-mode UX; complexity to serve both" }
    ]
  },
  {
    question: "What's the success signal?",
    header: "Success metric",
    options: [
      { label: "Team-wide adoption", description: "Qualitative; hard to measure" },
      { label: "Daily active use", description: "Quantitative DAU; needs tracking" },
      { label: "Time saved per task", description: "Efficiency metric; baseline needed" }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Depth Drill: Two Mechanisms

Drills happen at two distinct moments, with different judges. Both are required.

#### Type A: Inline Drill (You judge, in real time)

**When**: Immediately after an AskUserQuestion answer arrives.

**How**: Scan the selected option + any "Other" free-text for these signals. If present, the NEXT AskUserQuestion is a drill on the same node.

| Signal | Example answer | Drill question |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Vague qualifier** | "fast", "easy", "simple", "good UX" | AskUserQuestion with concrete thresholds as options (e.g., "<1s", "<3s", "<10s") |
| **Hidden assumption** | "obviously X", "of course Y" | AskUserQuestion surfacing the assumption ("does X always hold? What if not?") |
| **Multiple interpretations** | A term that could mean 2+ things (e.g., "admin") | AskUserQuestion listing each interpretation as an option |
| **New stakeholder** | Mentions a role not yet covered | Add a new node under the current axis, AskUserQuestion about their perspective |

Inline drills are fast and subjective — you catch the obvious ones on the spot.

#### Type B: Post-Audit Drill (gap-auditor judges, end of axis)

**When**: After an axis ends, gap-auditor returns verdict=CONTINUE with an AMBIGUOUS list.

**How**: The auditor's AMBIGUOUS list tells you exactly which nodes still need drilling. Convert each AMBIGUOUS item into an AskUserQuestion targeting that specific ambiguity, then continue until gap-auditor returns SUFFICIENT.

Post-audit drills are systematic — they catch what inline judgment missed.

#### Why Both

Type A is a fast first-pass filter; Type B is the safety net. Relying on only Type A means subjective blind spots slip through. Relying on only Type B means needlessly long axis rounds because trivially fixable ambiguities aren't caught early.

#### When Free-Text Is Acceptable

Only use free-text Q&A (no AskUserQuestion) when:
- The answer is genuinely open-ended (e.g., "describe your current workflow")
- You cannot construct 2+ distinct options honestly
- The question is exploratory to find option candidates for the next round

#### Handling "I Don't Know" — Classify Before Reacting

Users will sometimes not know the answer (especially on Tech axis, or when the PM doesn't know implementation details). Don't let the interview stall — but "I don't know" is NOT one state. Classify it first; the three types get three different treatments:

| Type | Signal | What it really means | Treatment |
|------|--------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Delegation** | "up to you", "whatever works", "아무거나", indifferent tone | The user is delegating the choice | Tentative default, continue |
| **Leaf deferral** | genuine "not sure", but the NEXT questions don't depend on this answer | An isolated unknown; the spec can carry it as a hole | Recommend + Open Decision, continue |
| **Structural deferral** | the answer determines which subsequent questions even make sense, OR the user signals decision anxiety ("그게 고민이야", "that's exactly what I'm wrestling with") | A decision problem, not a spec question. The requirement tree's shape depends on it | **Clarify Escalation Gate** (below) — immediately, on the FIRST occurrence |

**The classification test**: *Can I construct the next interview question without this answer?*
- Yes, unaffected → leaf deferral.
- No — the answer picks which subtree of the axis applies (who the user is, the core flow, local-first vs server-first, the data ownership model) → structural.
- Tone breaks ties: indifference = delegation; anxiety = structural.

**Delegation / leaf deferral treatment** (continue the interview):

1. **Make a tentative judgment**: Pick the reasonable default based on the WHERE context, existing research findings, and what experienced engineers would typically choose.
2. **Log it as an assumption**: Record in `qa-log.md` with `status: assumption` and include the reasoning in `> blockquote`.
3. **Add to Open Decisions**: Append an entry to `## Open Items` in qa-log.md with the undecided question, your tentative judgment, and why it can be deferred.
4. **Tell the user**: "I'll go with {X} for now, logged as an open decision. You can revisit it later."
5. **Count it** (leaf deferrals only, not delegations): increment `axis_deferrals[current_axis]`. If it reaches **2**, the axis itself is showing a pattern of undecidedness — trigger the Clarify Escalation Gate as a backstop.

Don't re-ask the same question. Move on. The Phase 4 Confirmation will let the user review and override any tentative judgment.

**Example (delegation)**:
```
Q: What authentication method?
User: "Dunno, whatever works"
→ Tentative: "Given brownfield-extension + sensitive-data, I'll assume existing SSO integration"
→ Log as assumption, add to Open Items, continue to next question
```

**Example (structural — do NOT default through this)**:
```
Q: Should edits sync across devices in real time, or is single-device fine?
User: "Hmm... that's actually what I keep going back and forth on"
→ Every INTERACTION question downstream (conflict UX, offline states) and half the
  TECH axis (storage, transport) depends on this. Defaulting here would fabricate
  the spec's skeleton. → Escalation Gate, first strike.
```

#### Clarify Escalation Gate

Fires on the **first** structural deferral, or as a backstop when `axis_deferrals[axis] == 2`. Escalation is always an OFFER — never silently dive into another workflow:

```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "This looks like an undecided design/scope problem, not a spec question — the rest of the interview depends on it. How do you want to handle it?",
  header: "Blocked decision",
  options: [
    { label: "Resolve it now via clarify (Recommended)", description: "Pause the interview, run a focused /clarify loop on just this decision (one question at a time, with recommendations), then resume here with the answer" },
    { label: "Assume and continue", description: "I pick a tentative default, log it as an Open Decision, and the interview continues on that assumption — the spec's shape may need rework if the assumption is wrong" }
  ]
)
```

**On "Resolve via clarify"**:

1. Write the current interview state to `qa-log.md` and note in its frontmatter: `paused_for: clarify`, plus the blocked question.
2. Invoke the clarify skill (Skill tool, `harness:clarify`), scoped to ONLY the blocked decision cluster — not the whole project. Pass as args: the blocked question, the mode (BUSINESS/INTERACTION axis → `requirements`; TECH axis or architecture forks → `design`), and `related_spec: <spec_dir>`.
3. When clarify returns SUFFICIENT, Read its `clarity-summary.md`, import each resolved decision into `qa-log.md` as `status: resolved` (cite the summary as source), remove the corresponding Open Items, and reset `axis_deferrals[axis]` to 0.
4. Resume the interview at the exact question that triggered the gate.

**On "Assume and continue"**: fall back to the leaf-deferral treatment above (it still counts toward `axis_deferrals`; a structural assumption is logged with an explicit `risk: structural-assumption` marker so Phase 4 surfaces it prominently).

#### Recording Answers

Update `qa-log.md` after each exchange using the template format:
- `#### Q:` for the question, `> blockquote` for the answer (include the selected option label + any free-text)
- `##### Drill:` for depth follow-ups
- Mark each with `status: resolved | ambiguous | assumption`

### Gap Audit Triggers

Dispatch the **gap-auditor** agent at these specific moments:

1. **End of axis** (required) — after you believe an axis is complete, before moving to the next
2. **Stuck on axis** (early check) — after 3 consecutive AskUserQuestion turns on the same axis without moving forward
3. **Final audit** (required) — after all 3 axes look done, before transitioning to Phase 2

Do NOT call gap-auditor after every AskUserQuestion turn — that's wasteful. Call it at boundaries.

### Gap Audit Flow

Each call:
1. Write current Q&A state to `qa-log.md` first
2. Dispatch **gap-auditor** with:
   - Full `qa-log.md` content
   - Which axis just completed (or "final" for the full audit)
3. Read the verdict:
   - **CONTINUE** → ask the agent's suggested questions (use AskUserQuestion)
   - **SUFFICIENT** → move on
4. **You do NOT decide completion yourself** — only gap-auditor can say SUFFICIENT

### Interview Completion

All 3 axes must receive **SUFFICIENT** verdict, AND the final audit must also return **SUFFICIENT**.
Update `qa-log.md` frontmatter: `status: complete` with final coverage scores.

## Phase 2: Requirements Extraction

Run 3 agents **in parallel**:

1. Read `${baseDir}/templates/reqs-axis.md` template
2. Dispatch simultaneously:
   - **business-extractor** agent with: qa-log.md content + template
   - **interaction-extractor** agent with: qa-log.md content + template
   - **tech-extractor** agent with: qa-log.md content + template
3. Write outputs to:
   - `.harness/specs/{spec-name}/reqs-business.md`
   - `.harness/specs/{spec-name}/reqs-interaction.md`
   - `.harness/specs/{spec-name}/reqs-tech.md`

## Phase 3: Cross-Check

1. Read all 3 reqs files
2. Detect issues across axes:
   - **CONFLICT**: requirements that contradict each other across axes
   - **GAP**: something mentioned in one axis but missing in others
   - **DUPLICATE**: same requirement expressed differently
3. Build a **Cross-Check Report** (in memory, not yet written to disk):
   - List each issue with the requirement IDs involved
   - Collect all `confidence: low` and `open_questions` items from extractor outputs
   - Collect all assumptions the extractors made (items inferred but not directly sourced from Q&A)

## Phase 4: User Confirmation & Finalization

Before writing the final `requirements.md`, surface everything to the user for explicit acceptance. This prevents assumptions from silently becoming "requirements."

### Step 4.1: Present Cross-Check Summary

Show the user a concise summary grouped into:

```
## Final Confirmation

### Confirmed Requirements
{count by axis: Business N, Interaction N, Tech N}

### Conflicts to Resolve ({count})
- {ID pair}: {conflict description}
  → Options to resolve

### Open Questions ({count})
- {ID}: {question} (axis: {axis})

### Assumptions to Accept ({count})
- {ID}: {assumption the extractor made} — accept / reject / replace

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)
- {items from where.non_goals}
```

### Step 4.2: Resolve via AskUserQuestion

For each CONFLICT and ASSUMPTION, use AskUserQuestion with options (typically: accept / reject / modify / defer).

For OPEN QUESTIONS: either answer them now (free-text or AskUserQuestion) or explicitly defer them to the open_decisions list.

### Step 4.3: Preview final requirements

After all conflicts and assumptions are resolved, show the full requirements list before writing to disk:

```
[specify] Final Requirements Preview

Type: greenfield | Goal: "<goal>"
Non-goals: <list>

## R-B1: <title>
  - R-B1.1: <sub title>
    given: ... | when: ... | then: ...
  - R-B1.2: ...

## R-U1: <title>
  - R-U1.1: ...

## R-T1: <title>
  - R-T1.1: ...

Summary: {N} parent reqs, {M} sub-reqs (B:{b} U:{u} T:{t})
Open Decisions: {count or "none"}
```

Then ask:
```
AskUserQuestion(
  question: "Finalize these requirements?",
  options: [
    { label: "Approve", description: "Write requirements.md and finish" },
    { label: "Edit", description: "Modify specific requirements before writing" },
    { label: "Re-interview", description: "Go back to interview for missing coverage" }
  ]
)
```

If **Edit**: ask which requirements to change, apply edits, re-show preview. Max 3 rounds.
If **Re-interview**: return to Phase 1 with the gap identified.

### Step 4.4: Write Final `requirements.md`

Only after user has explicitly approved the preview:

1. Read `${baseDir}/templates/requirements.md` template (cli format)
2. Overwrite `<spec_dir>/requirements.md` (replacing the stub created by `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh" req init` at Phase 0.3). Final shape:
   ```markdown
   ---
   type: greenfield | feature | refactor | bugfix
   goal: "<one-line goal>"
   non_goals:
     - "<item>"
   ---

   # Requirements

   ## R-B1: <parent title>
   - behavior: <one-sentence system behavior>

   #### R-B1.1: <sub title>
   - given: <precondition>
   - when: <trigger>
   - then: <expected outcome>

   #### R-B1.2: ...

   ## R-U1: <Interaction requirement parent>
   ...

   ## R-T1: <Tech requirement parent>
   ...

   ## Pre-work

   ### OD-1: <title>
   - context: <why undecided>
   - options: [<A>, <B>]
   - impact: <what is blocked>
   ```
3. **ID rules** (must match `/blueprint`'s expectations):
   - Parent: `## R-X<num>:` at H2, where `X` is axis code (`B`=Business, `U`=Interaction, `T`=Tech)
   - Sub: `#### R-X<num>.Y:` at H4 with `given/when/then` lines
   - No axis grouping headings in the body (flat list); axis is encoded in the ID letter
4. **Frontmatter** carries only `type`, `goal`, `non_goals[]`. Do NOT add extra keys like `spec`, `phase`, `date`, `total_requirements` — those broke with cli's frontmatter format.
5. Pre-work is optional — include only when the interview surfaced actions the user must complete before execution (e.g., "get API key", "run migration"). Mark each item `(blocking)` or `(non-blocking)`. execute will gate on blocking items.
6. Open Decisions is optional — omit the section if no unresolved decisions
7. Confirm completion with the user, showing final file path + next step: `/blueprint <spec_dir>/`

## Output Files

All outputs go to `<spec_dir>/` (default `.harness/specs/{spec-name}/`):

| File | Phase | Description | Consumed by |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `requirements.md` | 0.3 (stub) / 4.3 (final) | Requirements in cli format (frontmatter + flat `## R-X` / `#### R-X.Y` with GWT) | `/blueprint` |
| `qa-log.md` | 1 | Full interview transcript | audit/traceability only |
| `reqs-business.md` | 2 | Axis extraction scratch | merged into requirements.md |
| `reqs-interaction.md` | 2 | Axis extraction scratch | merged into requirements.md |
| `reqs-tech.md` | 2 | Axis extraction scratch | merged into requirements.md |

**Only `requirements.md` is load-bearing for downstream skills.** The other files are internal scratch/audit — /blueprint does not read them.

## CLI Dependency

- `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh" req init <spec_dir> --type <t> --goal "<g>"` (Phase 0.3) — creates dir + requirements.md stub
- No other cli commands are called by /specify. Phase 4.3 overwrites `requirements.md` directly via Write tool.

## Agents Used

| Agent | Phase | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `gap-auditor` | 1 | Interview coverage validation |
| `business-extractor` | 2 | Business req extraction |
| `interaction-extractor` | 2 | Interaction req extraction (project-type-aware) |
| `tech-extractor` | 2 | Tech req extraction |
