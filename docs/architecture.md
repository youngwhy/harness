# Architecture

## Overview

Harness is a Claude Code plugin that implements a **specify-blueprint-execute** development pipeline. The core idea: separate requirements, planning, and implementation into distinct phases so each can be independently validated, parallelized, and guarded by hooks.

1. **Specify** -- An interview-driven skill derives structured requirements, outputting `requirements.md`.
2. **Blueprint** -- A contract-first planner reads `requirements.md` and produces `plan.json` (task graph with dependencies) and `contracts.md` (interface contracts between tasks).
3. **Execute** -- A plan-driven orchestrator reads `plan.json`, dispatches worker agents using one of three dispatch modes (direct/agent/team), and runs verification at configurable depth.
4. **Hooks** -- Shell scripts registered in `.claude/settings.json` enforce guardrails at every lifecycle event: blocking premature writes, validating outputs, and auto-advancing the pipeline.

The plugin also ships standalone skills (council, bugfix, ralph, scope, etc.) that can be invoked independently outside the main pipeline.

## CLI

The plugin ships `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh"` (npm: `harness-cli`) for structured data management.

| Command Group | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `req` | Requirements management (read/merge `requirements.md`) |
| `plan` | Plan management (read/update `plan.json`, task status) |
| `learning` | Structured learnings (record, search via BM25) |
| `issue` | Structured issue tracking |
| `session` | Session state management |

Key conventions:
- File-based JSON passing via heredoc (`<< 'EOF'`) to avoid shell glob issues
- Task status updates: `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh" plan task <plan-path> --status <task-id>=<state>`
- Monotonic done-lock prevents re-opening completed tasks

## Patterns

### Requirements-Driven Development

All implementation flows through `requirements.md` -- a structured document containing requirements with sub-requirements expressed in GWT (Given/When/Then) format. The CLI (`bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cli.sh"`) manages requirements and plan state. `/blueprint` transforms requirements into an executable `plan.json` with `contracts.md` defining interface boundaries between tasks.

### 3-Axis Configuration (Execute)

The execute orchestrator supports three independent configuration axes:
- **Dispatch**: `direct` (orchestrator implements), `agent` (worker subagents with module grouping), `team` (TeamCreate persistent workers with claim-based assignment)
- **Work**: `worktree` (git worktree isolation), `branch` (branch-per-task), `no-commit` (in-place)
- **Verify**: `light` (build/lint only), `standard` (spec-based + code review), `thorough` (standard + cross-task + QA sandbox)

### Hook-Guarded Writes

The `skill-session-guard.sh` hook intercepts every `Edit` and `Write` tool call during specify and execute sessions. During specify, it prevents the orchestrator from writing code (planning only). During execute, it prevents the orchestrator from writing implementation directly (must delegate to worker agents). This enforces the separation of concerns between planning, orchestrating, and implementing.

### Contract-First Planning

`/blueprint` derives interface contracts (`contracts.md`) before building the task graph. Each task declares which contracts it produces and consumes. Workers receive contract paths and IDs in their charter -- never inlined content -- ensuring clean separation between orchestrator and worker concerns.

### DAG-Based Parallel Execution

Tasks in `plan.json` declare dependencies via `depends_on`. The execute orchestrator resolves these into a DAG and runs independent tasks in parallel. In agent mode, tasks are grouped by module for round-level commits. In team mode, workers claim tasks longest-deps-first.

### Stop Hook Re-injection (Ralph Pattern)

The `/ralph` skill uses the Stop hook to re-inject prompts into the session. When the agent tries to stop, `ralph-stop.sh` checks whether the Definition of Done is satisfied. If not, it outputs a continuation prompt that keeps the agent working. A circuit breaker (max iterations) prevents infinite loops.

### Validate-on-Complete

The `validate-output.sh` PostToolUse hook fires after every Task or Skill completion. It reads the `validate_prompt` from the agent/skill frontmatter and outputs it as a reminder, prompting the orchestrator to verify the output meets stated criteria before proceeding.
